# Assigment 1
For this project, our group decided to go with the standard social media website. It seemed like a fun idea and did not sound like an overly complicated challenge.

To begin our project we first tackled the design aspexts of this project and that first involved choosing the name of our social media platform, which we decided on "yoVerse", because it combined two words: your and universe, which is a great title for an up and coming social media platform where users can share their thoughts and experinces with the world. The next step in creating our social media platform was to figure out the graphic design aspect which included choosing the color scheme and creating a logo. To select the colors we utilized Coolors.co, to randomize different color patterns and find interesting color schemes that would fit our websites mood and feel. Once we settled on our desired color grid, we then chose one of the mpst eye catching colors and created a Logo with it to ensure it would match our website aesthetic. Our team used freelogodesign.org to create our logo with matching colors and moved on to designing our website.

To create our first draft we drew up a few pages in HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap. We utilized GitHub for our version control and to keep everything generally organized while working remotely and as a team. Dax was in charge of the general styling of the webstie which included most of the graphic aspects of our socail media platform. Dax also designed various classes and IDs to make the page more aesthetically pleasing as well as creating the [sign-up page](https://github.com/Temch4k/Assigment-1/blob/main/signup.html). Micah constructed the [home page](https://github.com/Temch4k/Assigment-1/blob/main/homePage.html), [profile](https://github.com/Temch4k/Assigment-1/blob/main/profilePage.html) [pages](https://github.com/Temch4k/Assigment-1/blob/main/profileSettings.html) and the [forgotten password page](https://github.com/Temch4k/Assigment-1/blob/main/forgotPassword.html), while Artsiom created the [sign-in page](https://github.com/Temch4k/Assigment-1/blob/main/signin.html) and worked on the scaling of pages for different windows sizes to suit all users and ensure that whatever platform is being used to view our social media website that it would look appropriate. Artsiom also did some maintenance on the pages, making sure that the footers and headers were correctly sized and were anchored in the appropriate places.

Our design is trying to section the page into relative sections. It seemed most appropriate to set each section in rectangular sections with curved edges in some sections. We choose this styling in order to look similar to other professional sites such at Twitter and Facebook while looking different enough with the defined staggered box layout to stand out from the crowd while still maintaining a familiar feel for our users.
