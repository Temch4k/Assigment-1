# Assigment 1
-For this project, our group decided to go with the standard social media website. It seemed like a fun idea and did not sound like an overly complicated challenge. First, we chose to name our website yoVerse, because it combined two words: your and universe, which seemed like a good title for a social media website where people can share their thoughts and experiences. Our next step was to choose the color scheme we were going to go for. To figure select the colors we used Coolors.co, to randomize different color patterns and see what we like. After we settled on the desired color grid, we chose one of those colors and created a Logo with it to make sure it matches our website aesthetic.  -Our team used freelogodesign.org to create our logo with matching colors and moved on to designing our website.
To create our first few pages, we used HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap to put it all together, as well as GitHub, to keep everything in one place and organized. Dax was responsible for the Sing Up page. Micah went for the home and "forgot your password?" pages. Artsiom created the sign-in page and worked on the scaling of the web pages for different sizes of browser windows. He also did some maintenance on the pages, making sure that the footers and headers were the right sizes, and were located where they were supposed to be instead of moving around the screen while scrolling.
